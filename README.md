Galaxy-O-Meter is a sentiment analysis project that analyzes tweets related to three recent Star Wars shows using Azure Cognitive Services Text Analysis API, and visualizes the results on my website. 

Note: the frontend directory isn't meant to actually work, it's just for reference what's also on my personal site where the display is hosted.
