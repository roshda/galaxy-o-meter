Galaxy-O-Meter is a sentiment analysis project that analyzes tweets related to three recent Star Wars shows using Azure Cognitive Services Text Analysis API, and visualizes the results on my website. 

scraping.py: because the Twitter/X API is super expensive now, I had to scrape tweets manually with selenium. There's only a few hundred tweets total because I didn't want to get banned and I'm not an elite web scraper setting up 10 fake accounts or anything. I'll definitely add more on the next run scraping + analyzing tweets. 

Note: the frontend directory isn't meant to actually work, it's just to show what's also on my personal site where the display is hosted.
